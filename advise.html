           <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br><br>

            Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, 
            and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
            <br><br> Deadly surge in COVID-19 cases has placed an enormous strain on health and critical care facilities in India, 
               leaving vulnerable families paying a particularly steep price.<br> 
Urgent action is needed to avert further tragic loss of life.<br>

            <p>
                Work from home is currently the new norm rather than exception and while it was often a dream for many employees,
                 yet in the current scenario many have found it difficult to navigate.<br><br>
                 During this time mental fatigue can be brought on by a variety of reasons, namely, the constant surveillance when outside or around people,
                  the limited social contact, the uncertainty of when covid-19 will end or what the future would look like, juggling a number of tasks at the same time, 
                  trying to remember all the things that need to be done, not getting a break from family/ roommates, and the list can go on.
                  <br><br>

            <p>    
                 1. Set your timer for 25 minutes and start working.<br>
                  When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break.<br>
                  Then, set the timer again and get back to work.<br>
                  After four 25-minute work sessions, your fourth break should be longer! (About 20 to 30 minutes.)<br><br>
                  2. Connect with your co-workers beyond business.<br><br>
                 3. Stay nourished and hydrated.<br><br>
                 4. Refresh your workspace.<br><br>
